	Hi, my name is Luis Moneda, i'm a computer engineering student at Escola Polit√©cnica/USP and i have a BSc degree in Economics from the same University.
	I'm working with mathematical modeling, solving problems using Machine Learning approaches.

	I used to be a <a href="https://www.codeclubbrasil.org">Code Club Brasil</a> coordinator too.
	
	I'm interested in Machine Learning, Microeconomics and Econometrics. I hope to write about these subjects here.
