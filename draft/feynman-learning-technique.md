A simple and effective technique from Richard Feynman to learn something. We can use two Feynman quotes to show the importance of the technique:

> "The first principle is that you must not fool youself - and you're the easiest person to fool."

Since it's a way of test your understading of a concept, it makes you face your current knowledge and obligate youself to correct the weak spots. We all know how we like to fool ourselves avoiding to test knowledge we're not so confortable about.

> "What I cannot create, I do not understand."

Create here is placed with the meaning of "recreate", "deduce" and so on. If you think you know a concept only by reading it, try to test it with this technique. Probably, you won't find that easy to construct that knowledge from the very basic.


1. Take a paper/file and write the concept name you're trying to learn at the top of it.
2. Explain the concept in simple language. Give examples, make use of the concept.
3. Identify the areas of your explanation you're not very sure about. Then try to find sources that make you feel confortable about it. Why does it work? What does it imply?
4. Find any complicated part of your explanation and simplify it, try to imagine you're exposing it to a person that do not have the same background as you.
