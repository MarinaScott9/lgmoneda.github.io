<p>The choosen dataset was the "U.S. National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC)". </p>

<p>The topic of interest is about alcohol dependence associated with family history of alcoholism.</p>

<p>Our question is: is family history of alcoholism most significant in alcohol dependent people? Can it be used to define a risk group?</p>

<p>Our hypothesis is that we can predict and define a risk group for alcohol dependence with a reasonable accuracy using family history of alcohol abuse.</p>

<p>Looking for the literature about it, i've looked for "family profile of alcohol dependence". It's a largely studied theme: what are the characteristics that influents people to become alcohol dependent. We can see some examples of works in this way: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871602002259"> "Substance use, abuse and dependence in adolescence: prevalence, symptom profiles and correlates"</a>, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/112/1/64/"> "Risk and protective factors for alcohol and other drug problems in adolescence and early adulthood: Implications for substance abuse prevention."</a>, and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-0277.1988.tb00232.x/abstract;jsessionid=EDB4F6692DECEE113FEB6E80BA6202A4.f04t03">Childhood Personality Predicts Alcohol Abuse in Young Adults</a>.</p>

<p>In (Hawkings et al, 1992), many risk factors are identified in their conclusion, including family aspects. Here, we'd investigate the family history about dependencies significance.</p>

<p>These works and others usually try to find and define a risk group, for focused policies on them, and predictive power using data to find potential dependents. Our study here will follow this same objective: can we predict and/or distinguish risk groups? </p>

<p>It's not easy to define all the data we're going to use without taking a look in it, but we expect to use the following sections from the entire Codebook:</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>SECTION 1: BACKGROUND INFORMATION</li>
	<li>SECTION 2A: ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</li>
	<li>SECTION 2B: ALCOHOL ABUSE/DEPENDENCE (ALCOHOL EXPERIENCES)</li>
	<li>SECTION 2C: ALCOHOL TREATMENT UTILIZATION</li>
	<li>SECTION 2D: FAMILY HISTORY (I) OF ALCOHOLISM</li>
	<li>SECTION 3E: FAMILY HISTORY (II) OF DRUG ABUSE</li>
</ul>
</p>
