title: "ML101 #1: Least Mean Squares Regression in Python"

Since i've been working through some basic Machine Learning lately, due a "Computer Intelligence" course in college, i decided to share my assignments, after adding some theory chunks. 

I was uncertain about sharing it directly here or through an iPython Notebook, then i will give to the latter the first chance.

Maybe, it'll get larger than just these assigments, so i'm calling it a "Machine Learning 101" series. It won't follow a certain order.

I hope it can be useful.
