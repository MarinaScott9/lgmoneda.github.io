title: Machine Learning 101
---

<p>Since i've been studying some basic Machine Learning lately, i decided to share some of my assignments, after adding some theory chunks. Unfortunetly, i can't share anything from the MOOCs i've been taking, due to the honor code. But i can try to extract some cool stuff from them, always looking for a visual appeal. </p>

<p>I was uncertain about sharing it directly here or through an iPython Notebook, then i will give to the latter the first chance.</p>

<p>Maybe, it'll get larger than just some assigments, so i'm calling it a "Machine Learning 101" series. It won't follow a certain order.</p>

<p>I hope it can be useful.</p>
